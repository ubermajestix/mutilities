Mutilities is an app for Google+ Hangout.

It provides a few nice utilities to manage muting yourself and everyone else
on the hangout.

When you hold down the "push to mute" button, you will be muted until
you release it. You can change this button to "push to talk" by clicking
on the gear button. You can also press the "m" key instead of clicking
this button.

Sometimes on a hangout its useful to mute everyone else, and that is
what the "mute everyone" button does. This is helpful in reducing noise
or feedback from an unknown participant while you are talking.
